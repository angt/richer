# Why the rich are getting richer

This is a super simple model which partially explains the disparity in wealth.

Simulate agents who make small transactions and since the price of things is never perfect,
there are always one player in the transaction who loses a little and the other who wins.
You run the code and presto, super rich appear :)

Here, 65536 agents start with 100Kâ‚¬, each dot is 10M random transactions.
